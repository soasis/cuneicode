# Cuneicode

> If you follow the River, you will find the C.

This library is the hyper-focused span-based C library for Unicode Transformation Format encoding and decoding that is implementing the ideas found in [the latest and greatest of the encoding papers for C functions](https://thephd.dev/_vendor/future_cxx/papers/C%20-%20Restartable%20and%20Non-Restartable%20Character%20Functions%20for%20Efficient%20Conversions.html), plus additional functionality:


```c

```
